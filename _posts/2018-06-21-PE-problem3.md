## Largest prime factor

---

## Problem Statement
[Problem 3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3) : The prime factors of $$13195$$ are $$5, \ 7, \ 13$$ and $$29$$. What is the largest prime factor of the number $$600851475143$$ ?

## Concept and Theory
The main idea behind this problem is to understand the basic factoring concept, i.e **"any number, $$N$$, can have at-most one prime factor bigger than its $$\sqrt{N}$$, unless the number itself is prime"**. Just like sieving in Sieve of Eratosthenes we do our computations.
- Since $$2$$ is the only special case, only even prime number, we will handle its case separately and keep updating our $$currentLargestFactor$$.
- After handling $$2$$'s special case, $$currentLargestFactor = 3$$ and we update it in increment of $$2$$ as we only care about odd numbers(because they are the only possible solution).
- As a last step, if after looping over $$\sqrt{N}$$ we are still left with some number we will simply make that number our answer. Why ? Because that will be the only one prime bigger than $$\sqrt{N}$$.

## Code
```ruby
/**
 * A function to calculate the largest prime factor of given number
 *
 * @param num
 *            : given number
 * @return largest prime factor of given number
 */
public static long largestPrimeFactor(long num) {

  long searchingRangeMaxNum = (long) Math.sqrt(num);
  long currentLargestFactor = 2;
  long largestFactor = 1;

  if (num % currentLargestFactor == 0) {
    largestFactor = currentLargestFactor;
    num /= currentLargestFactor;
    while (num % currentLargestFactor == 0) {
      num /= currentLargestFactor;
    }
  }

  if (num == 1) {
    return largestFactor;
  }

  currentLargestFactor = 3;

  while (currentLargestFactor <= searchingRangeMaxNum) {
    if (num % currentLargestFactor == 0) {
      while (num % currentLargestFactor == 0) {
        num = num / currentLargestFactor;
      }
      largestFactor = currentLargestFactor;
    }
    currentLargestFactor += 2;
  }
  if (num > 1) {
    largestFactor = num;
  }
  return largestFactor;
}

### Solution
The solution will remain same as above method $$largestPrimeFactor$$, you just need to call it for each test case.
