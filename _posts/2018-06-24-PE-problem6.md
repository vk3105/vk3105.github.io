## Problem Statement : Sum square difference
[Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) : The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
{: .text-justify}

$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
{: .text-justify}

$$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $$3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640$$.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Concept and Theory
The sum of square of first $$n$$ terms of natural number is given as follows,
{: .text-justify}

$$(1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2) \ = \ \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$

And sum of first $$n$$ terms of natural number is given as follows,
{: .text-justify}

$$(1+2+ \dots + n) \ = \ \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

We are asked,

$$=\Bigg ( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Bigg )^2 - \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$

$$=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Bigg [ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \ - \ \frac{2n+1}{3}  \Bigg] $$

$$=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Bigg [ \frac{3n^2+3n-4n-2}{6} \Bigg] $$

$$=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Bigg [ \frac{3n^2-n-2}{6} \Bigg] $$

$$=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Bigg [ \frac{(3n+2)(n-1)}{6} \Bigg] $$

$$=\frac{n(n+1)(n-1)(3n+2)}{12} $$


### Code
```ruby
/**
 * A function that calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the
 * squares of the first natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * @param num
 *            : the last number in the series
 *
 * @return result
 */
public static long sumSquareDifference(long num) {
  long result = (num * (num - 1) * (num + 1) * (3 * num + 2)) / 12;
  return result;
}
```
