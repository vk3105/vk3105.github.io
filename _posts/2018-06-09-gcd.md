## Definition
GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of two or more given numbers, not all zero, is the highest possible number which divides them all.

$$GCD = \text{Multiplication of common factors}\\ \text{of all given numbers}$$

Lets see how we can code it in different ways.

## Prime factorization
Its as per the definition and discussed above. I will cover the code for factorization process in another article.
So, one can say, let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be the two numbers with unique prime factorization given as,

$$A = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} p_3^{a_3}\dots{p_n^{a_n}}$$\\
$$B = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} p_3^{b_3}\dots p_n^{b_n}$$

$$gcd(A,B) = p_1^{min(a_1,b_1)} p_2^{min(a_2,b_2)} p_3^{min(a_3,b_3)}\dots p_n^{min(a_n,b_n)}$$

Before diving deep into coding lets look at some examples.

### Find the GCD of 36 and 24.
Lets do the prime factorization of both the numbers, 36 and 24.

$$36 = 2^2 \times 3^2$$\\
$$24 = 2^3 \times 3^1$$

$$gcd(24,36) = 2^{min(2,3)} 3^{min(2,1)} = 12$$

### Find the GCD of 15, 21 and 6.
Again, start by prime factorization of all the given numbers.

$$6 = 2^1 \times 3^1$$\\
$$15 = 3^1 \times 5^1$$\\
$$21 = 3^1 \times 7^1$$

$$gcd(6,15,21) = 2^{min(1,0,0)} 3^{min(1,1,1)} 5^{min(0,1,0)} 7^{min(0,0,1)}\\
= 3$$

I will cover the factorization code and what are the efficient ways to do so in another article.

## Euclid's algorithm
The Euclidean algorithm says that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. Alternatively, the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference.([Why??](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Procedure)).

Following the above definition one can say\\

$$gcd(a,0) = a$$\\
$$gcd(0,b) = b$$\\
$$gcd(a,b) = a \ \ \ \ \text{if} \ a = b$$\\
$$gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) \ \ \, \ \text{if} \ a > b$$ \\
$$gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a) \ \ \, \ \text{if} \ b > a$$\\
$$\text{After all, a's greatest divisor is itself, which is also a}\\ \text{divisor of zero.}$$

Lets convert this into some code,

### Iterative Version
```
/**
 * An iterative function to return the GCD of two numbers
 *
 * @param a
 *            first number
 * @param b
 *            second number
 * @return gcd of a & b
 */
static int iterativeGCD(int a, int b) {
  if (a == 0) {
    return b;
  } else if (b == 0) {
    return a;
  }

  while (a != b) {
    if (a > b) {
      a = a - b;
    } else {
      b = b - a;
    }
  }
  return a;
}
```
### Recurvive Version
```
/**
	 * A recursive function to return the GCD of two numbers
	 *
	 * @param a
	 *            first number
	 * @param b
	 *            second number
	 * @return gcd of a & b
	 */
	static int recursiveGCD(int a, int b) {
		if (a == 0) { // Case 1
			return b;
		} else if (b == 0) { // Case 2
			return a;
		}

		if (a == b) { // Case 3
			return a;
		}

		if (a > b) { // Case 4
			return recursiveGCD(a - b, b);
		} else { // Case 5
			return recursiveGCD(a, b - a);
		}
	}
```

Lets look at another definition
$$gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b \ \text{mod}\ a) \ \ \  \text{if} \ b \neq 0$$ \\
$$gcd(a,b) = gcd(a \ \text{mod}\ b,b) \ \ \  \text{if} \ a \neq 0$$ \\
$$\text{where} \ a \ \text{mod} \ b = a - b \lfloor{a/b}\rfloor$$



## Additional important properties

## Practical use
GCD has many applications in computer science like solving equations, cryptography etc. Lets see how we can implement it in code.
