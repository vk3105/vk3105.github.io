## Problem Statement
[Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) : If we list all the natural numbers below $$10$$ that are multiples of $$3$$ or $$5$$, we get $$3$$, $$5$$, $$6$$ and $$9$$. The sum of these multiples is $$23$$.
Find the sum of all the multiples of $$3$$ or $$5$$ below $$1000$$.

## Concept and Theory
The concept is straight forward from Set Theory and Arithmetic Progression.

[Venn_A_intersect_B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#/media/File:Venn_A_intersect_B.svg){: style="text-align: center;"}

So lets say $$A$$ represents all the multiples of $$3$$ and $$B$$ represents all the multiples of $$5$$. But there are some numbers like $$15$$, $$30$$, $$45$$ which are multiple of both $$3$$ and $$5$$. We have to count them only once not twice.

$$A \cup B = A + B - A \cap B , \\
\text{where} \ A \ = \ Sum \ of \ multiple \ of \ three \\
B \ = \ Sum \ of \ multiple \ of \ five \\
A \cap B \ = \ Sum \ of \ multiple \ of \ Fifteen$$

So all that is left is just one thing, how to get the sum of all these multiples.
The answer is counting how many terms are there which are less than the given limit. From there its simple, the quotient of $$N/3$$ will give us the numbers of terms in the series, excluding the last number if it happens to be a multiple of $$3$$ or $$5$$ or $$15$$. Last term of the sequence can be calculated just by simply multiplying $$3$$, $$5$$ or $$15$$ with corresponding number of terms in sequence.

We knows that the sum of any given Arithmetic Progression can be given as,

$$ sum = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n) \\
where \ n = \text{number of terms} \\
a_1 = \text{first term of the sequence} \\
a_n = \text{last term of the sequence}$$

That's it. Just plug in the numbers and you will have your answer.

## Code

```
/**
 * A function that returns the sum of all the unique multiples of 3 and 5 below
 * given input n.
 *
 * Note : We have to exclude the n if its a multiple of 3 or 5
 *
 * @param n
 *            : input range
 * @return : the sum
 */
static public int sumOfMultiplesOf3And5(int n) {
  int res = 0;

  int numberOfTermsThreeSeries = n % 3 == 0 ? (n / 3) - 1 : n / 3;
  int maxMultipleOfThree = (numberOfTermsThreeSeries) * 3;

  int numberOfTermsFiveSeries = n % 5 == 0 ? (n / 5) - 1 : n / 5;
  int maxMultipleOfFive = (numberOfTermsFiveSeries) * 5;

  int numberOfTermsFifteenSeries = n % 15 == 0 ? (n / 15) - 1 : n / 15;
  int maxMultipleOfFifteen = (numberOfTermsFifteenSeries) * 15;

  int sumOfMultipleOfThree = ((numberOfTermsThreeSeries * (3 + maxMultipleOfThree)) / 2);
  int sumOfMultipleOfFive = ((numberOfTermsFiveSeries * (5 + maxMultipleOfFive)) / 2);
  int sumOfMultipleOfFifteen = ((numberOfTermsFifteenSeries * (15 + maxMultipleOfFifteen)) / 2);

  res = sumOfMultipleOfThree + sumOfMultipleOfFive - sumOfMultipleOfFifteen;

  return res;
}
```
